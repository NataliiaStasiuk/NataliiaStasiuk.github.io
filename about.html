<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>The Story of Little Ukrainian Potato</h2>
<p><big> I was born and grew up in the small town of the West of Ukraine. In order to get a better education I left home and went to boarding school at the age of ten. My senior year of high shcool I have spent on the exchange program in the USA, where I lived with randomley assigned host family and went to American school for ten months. As a result, being for so long on my own, far away from home have made me very independent and responsible.</big></p>

<p><big>I consider myself to be very outgoing and friendly, which makes me a great team member! My greatest personality trait is being a fast learner and do my job with integrity and efficiency. I always put the needs of others before my own and approach any task with great responsibility and enthusiasm. I also enjoy communicating with people and being of use to others.</big></p>
